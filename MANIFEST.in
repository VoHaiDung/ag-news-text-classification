# Package Manifest for AG News Text Classification
# ============================================================================
# Project: AG News Text Classification (ag-news-text-classification)
# Description: Specification of files included in source distribution
# Author: Võ Hải Dũng
# Email: vohaidung.work@gmail.com
# License: MIT
# ============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   This manifest specifies which files should be included in or excluded
#   from the source distribution when building the package with setuptools.
#   Ensures proper package distribution with all necessary files while
#   excluding development artifacts and large binary files.
#
# Syntax Reference:
#   include <pattern>                   - Include matching files
#   recursive-include <dir> <pattern>   - Include recursively from directory
#   exclude <pattern>                   - Exclude matching files
#   recursive-exclude <dir> <pattern>   - Exclude recursively from directory
#   global-exclude <pattern>            - Exclude pattern globally
#   graft <dir>                         - Include entire directory
#   prune <dir>                         - Exclude entire directory
#
# Build Commands:
#   Source distribution:  python setup.py sdist
#   Wheel distribution:   python setup.py bdist_wheel
#   Both:                 python -m build
#   Verify:               python setup.py sdist --dry-run --verbose

# ============================================================================
# Notes
# ============================================================================
#
# Included in Distribution:
#   - All source code and configurations
#   - All documentation and guides
#   - All scripts and tools
#   - IDE configurations for 10 IDEs
#   - Test suite and fixtures
#   - Sample data and metadata
#   - Deployment configurations
#   - Templates and examples
#
# Excluded from Distribution:
#   - Large model weights (download separately)
#   - Training data (download via scripts)
#   - Build artifacts
#   - Cache files
#   - IDE-specific runtime files
#   - OS-specific files
#   - Environment secrets
#   - Training logs and checkpoints
#
# Estimated Package Size:
#   - Source distribution: 50-100 MB
#   - Wheel distribution: 30-60 MB
#   - Without data and models: manageable for PyPI
#
# Installation Workflow:
#   1. Install package: pip install ag-news-text-classification
#   2. Download data: python scripts/setup/download_all_data.py
#   3. Download models: python scripts/setup/download_pretrained_models.py
#   4. Run setup: ag-news-setup
#
# Verification:
#   python setup.py sdist --dry-run --verbose | grep -E "adding|copying"
#   tar -tzf dist/ag-news-text-classification-1.0.0.tar.gz | head -50
