Dependency Flow:
  → : Direct Dependency
  ⇢ : Optional/Plugin Dependency
  ┊ : Configuration Dependency
```

The dependency architecture follows a strict layered pattern where higher layers depend on lower layers but not vice versa. The core infrastructure layer provides foundational abstractions used throughout the system. The ML components layer implements domain-specific functionality for models, training, and data processing. The service layer orchestrates business logic by composing ML components. The application layer exposes functionality through multiple API protocols.

This layered architecture enforces separation of concerns, reduces coupling, and facilitates independent testing and deployment of system components. The registry and factory patterns in the core infrastructure enable loose coupling through dependency injection, allowing components to be substituted without modifying dependent code.

### Configuration Management Strategy

The configuration management system employs a hierarchical composition strategy that balances flexibility with maintainability:

**Layered Configuration Composition**: Configurations are organized in layers from general to specific. Base configurations define common parameters applicable across multiple contexts. Specialized configurations extend base configurations with context-specific overrides. Environment configurations provide deployment-specific settings. This layering enables configuration reuse while maintaining the ability to override specific parameters as needed.

**YAML-Based Declarative Specification**: All configurations utilize YAML format for human readability and ease of editing. YAML's support for references, anchors, and aliases facilitates configuration composition without duplication. The declarative nature ensures configurations serve as executable documentation of system behavior.

**Dynamic Configuration Loading**: The configuration loader (`/configs/config_loader.py`) implements dynamic loading with environment variable interpolation, path resolution, and validation. Configurations can reference environment variables for sensitive parameters (API keys, database credentials) while maintaining version control safety. The loader supports multiple configuration sources with defined precedence rules: environment variables override file-based configurations, which override default values.

**Type-Safe Configuration Objects**: Configuration YAML files are parsed into strongly-typed Python objects with validation using Pydantic models. This approach catches configuration errors at load time rather than runtime, improving system reliability. Type annotations provide IDE support for configuration editing.

**Feature Flags**: The feature flags configuration (`/configs/features/feature_flags.yaml`) enables runtime control of system capabilities without code deployment. Features can be enabled/disabled per environment, facilitating gradual rollout, A/B testing, and emergency feature disabling.

**Secrets Management**: Sensitive configuration parameters are segregated into secrets templates (`/configs/secrets/`) that are never committed to version control. Production deployments integrate with secure secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) while development environments use local `.env` files.

### Supporting Infrastructure

**Testing Infrastructure (`/tests/`)**: Implements comprehensive test coverage organized by test type. Unit tests verify individual component behavior in isolation. Integration tests validate interaction between components. Performance tests benchmark speed, memory usage, and accuracy. End-to-end tests simulate complete user workflows. Fixtures provide reusable test data, mock objects, and configuration templates.

**Documentation System (`/docs/`)**: Provides multi-layered documentation including getting started guides, user guides for common tasks, developer guides for system extension, API references with generated documentation from code, architectural decision records (ADRs) documenting significant design choices, operational runbooks for deployment and troubleshooting, and tutorials with worked examples.

**Notebook Collection (`/notebooks/`)**: Contains Jupyter notebooks organized by purpose. Tutorial notebooks provide step-by-step learning materials. Exploratory notebooks document data analysis and hypothesis generation. Experiment notebooks record model development iterations. Analysis notebooks present interpretability studies and error analysis. Deployment notebooks demonstrate optimization and serving strategies.

**Deployment Artifacts (`/deployment/`)**: Encompasses containerization (Docker, Docker Compose), orchestration (Kubernetes manifests), cloud-specific deployments (AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML), edge deployment configurations (TensorFlow Lite, Core ML), and serverless deployment templates.

**Monitoring Infrastructure (`/monitoring/`)**: Integrates observability tools including Grafana dashboards for visualization, Prometheus for metrics collection, Kibana for log analysis, alert rules for automated incident detection, and custom metric collectors for ML-specific monitoring (prediction latency, model drift, data quality).

**Scripts Collection (`/scripts/`)**: Provides automation for common tasks including environment setup, data preparation, model training orchestration, evaluation report generation, hyperparameter search, model optimization, deployment automation, and API/service management.

### Extension and Customization Systems

**Plugin Architecture (`/plugins/`)**: Enables system extension without modifying core code. Plugin interfaces define contracts for custom components. Plugin categories include custom models (novel architectures), data sources (proprietary datasets), evaluators (domain-specific metrics), and processors (specialized preprocessing). Plugins are discovered through the registry system and loaded dynamically based on configuration.

**Template System (`/templates/`)**: Provides boilerplate code for common extensions including experiment templates, model implementation templates, dataset handler templates, evaluation metric templates, and API endpoint templates. Templates follow established patterns and include placeholder comments guiding implementation.

**Migration Framework (`/migrations/`)**: Manages schema evolution for data, models, configurations, and APIs. Data migrations handle dataset schema changes. Model migrations provide version compatibility layers. Configuration migrations automate updates when configuration schemas evolve. API migrations support versioned API endpoints with graceful deprecation.

### Resource Organization

**Output Directory (`/outputs/`)**: Centralizes all generated artifacts including trained model checkpoints, evaluation results, analysis outputs, training logs, and experimental artifacts (figures, tables, presentations). Organization by experiment ID and timestamp enables traceability and reproducibility.

**Benchmarking Results (`/benchmarks/`)**: Stores standardized benchmark outputs for accuracy comparisons, speed profiling, efficiency measurements, robustness evaluation, and scalability testing. Benchmark results enable objective model comparison and performance regression detection.

**Cache Directory (`/cache/`)**: Maintains cached computation results for Redis-backed distributed caching, Memcached for session caching, and local disk caching for development environments. Caching strategies balance memory usage against computation reduction.

## System Architecture Overview

### Architectural Philosophy

The AG News Text Classification System architecture is founded upon several core design principles that guide all implementation decisions:

**Modularity and Separation of Concerns**: Each system component encapsulates a single, well-defined responsibility with minimal coupling to other components. This modularity enables independent development, testing, and deployment of system capabilities. Components interact through well-defined interfaces rather than implementation details, facilitating component substitution and system evolution.

**Layered Architecture**: The system employs strict layering where each layer depends only on layers below it, never above. This unidirectional dependency flow prevents circular dependencies and facilitates reasoning about system behavior. Layers include infrastructure (core abstractions, utilities), domain logic (ML components, data processing), services (business logic orchestration), and application (API endpoints, user interfaces).

**Microservices for Scalability**: Core functionality is decomposed into independently deployable services communicating through well-defined protocols. This microservices approach enables horizontal scaling of high-demand services (prediction) independently from lower-demand services (training), optimizes resource utilization, provides fault isolation, and supports polyglot implementation where appropriate.

**Configuration-Driven Behavior**: System behavior is controlled through declarative configuration rather than code modification. This approach enables experimentation without code changes, supports multiple deployment environments from a single codebase, facilitates A/B testing through feature flags, and documents system behavior explicitly.

**Extensibility Through Abstractions**: The architecture defines clear abstraction boundaries with plugin interfaces enabling system extension without core modification. The registry pattern discovers extensions dynamically, factory patterns instantiate components based on configuration, and strategy patterns allow algorithm substitution.

**Production-First Design**: All components are designed with production deployment requirements in mind including comprehensive error handling, extensive logging and monitoring, graceful degradation under failure conditions, security controls (authentication, authorization, encryption), and performance optimization.

**Scientific Reproducibility**: The architecture incorporates reproducibility requirements throughout including deterministic execution through seed management, comprehensive experiment tracking, artifact versioning and provenance, statistical significance testing, and detailed documentation of experimental protocols.

This high-level architecture illustrates the complete system topology from external clients through multiple architectural layers to storage infrastructure. Each layer provides specific capabilities while maintaining clear boundaries and communication protocols.

**External Layer**: Represents diverse client types including web browsers, mobile applications, and programmatic clients used by data scientists. Clients interact with the system exclusively through the API Gateway, never directly accessing internal services.

**API Gateway Layer**: Provides centralized access control, request routing, and cross-cutting concerns. The gateway implements authentication using multiple schemes (JWT tokens, OAuth2 flows, API keys), rate limiting to prevent abuse, request validation ensuring data integrity, CORS policy enforcement, and request/response transformation for protocol adaptation. Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple gateway instances for high availability.

**API Protocol Layer**: Exposes three protocol interfaces serving different use cases. REST API (FastAPI framework) provides standard HTTP/JSON endpoints suitable for web clients and general integration. gRPC API offers high-performance binary protocol communication optimal for service-to-service communication and high-throughput scenarios. GraphQL API enables flexible query patterns allowing clients to request precisely the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues.

**Service Mesh Layer**: Implements service infrastructure concerns through sidecar proxies (Istio, Linkerd). The mesh handles service discovery eliminating hardcoded service locations, client-side load balancing, circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures, automatic retry logic with exponential backoff, traffic management for canary deployments and A/B testing, and comprehensive observability through distributed tracing and metrics collection.

**Microservices Layer**: Encapsulates business logic in domain-specific services. Prediction Service handles inference requests including single predictions, batch processing, and streaming classification. Training Service orchestrates model development workflows including hyperparameter optimization, distributed training, and experiment tracking. Data Service manages dataset lifecycle including preprocessing, augmentation, and quality validation. Model Management Service maintains model registry, version control, and deployment workflows.

**Core ML Components**: Implements machine learning functionality including model library (transformer architectures, ensembles, efficient models), training pipeline (trainers, strategies, optimization), and data pipeline (datasets, preprocessing, augmentation). These components are used by microservices but can also be utilized directly for research and experimentation.

**Supporting Infrastructure**: Provides operational capabilities including distributed caching (Redis, Memcached) for performance, message queuing (Celery, RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing, metrics collection (Prometheus) and visualization (Grafana), centralized logging (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin).

**Data & Storage Layer**: Manages persistent state including object storage (S3, GCS) for model artifacts and datasets, relational/document databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for metadata and system state, and shared file systems (NFS, EFS) for high-throughput data access.
